# Cybersecurity Dashboard

A hands-on project demonstrating my skills in log analysis, threat detection, and building SOC-style tools.  
This dashboard was created as part of my journey to becoming a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst** and showcases my ability to work with real-world cybersecurity data.

---

## Why I Built This
Cybersecurity analysts need to quickly detect suspicious activity and provide actionable insights.  
This project simulates a SOC environment where I:
- Parse and analyze raw logs
- Detect failed logins & suspicious IP activity
- Visualize trends for faster decision-making
- Export findings for reporting

---

## Features
- **Log Analysis**: Parse system/application logs to extract key events  
- **Threat Detection**: Highlight failed login attempts & non-private IP addresses  
- **Interactive Visuals**: Charts and summaries for incident review  
- **Exportable Reports**: Generate CSV reports for investigations  

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python scripting (pandas, regex for log parsing)
- Web development with Flask (frontend + backend)
- Data visualization using Chart.js / Plotly
- Creating exportable security reports (CSV/JSON)
- Applying SOC-style investigation workflows

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data**: Pandas for analysis
- **Visuals**: Chart.js / Plotly for interactive charts
